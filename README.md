# Real-time-Weather-Appâ›…ðŸŒ§

This is a weather app project built with Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS. For getting meteorological information, <b>OpenWeatherMap</b> Current Weather API is used. 
This app displays weather data from the API like this: an icon that represents the current weather status, the temperature value in Celsius units as well as Fahrenheit units, the weather description, and finally the userâ€™s city and country.

The temperature value gets converted from Celsius to Fahrenheit when the user clicks on it.
